Welcome to the Flight Data Pipeline and Analysis Repository!

This project is designed to extract comprehensive flight data from various flight APIs, process it through a robust data pipeline, and finally, construct an insightful dashboard for in-depth analysis.
With the power of data engineering and analytics, we aim to provide valuable insights into the world of aviation, helping you make informed decisions based on real-time and historical flight data.
Dive into the code, explore the data, and leverage the dashboard to uncover trends, patterns, and valuable information about flights and airlines.
